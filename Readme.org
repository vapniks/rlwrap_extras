* About
Some filters and completions files for [[https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap][rlwrap]].
* Installation
Place the completions files in your $RLWRAP_HOME directory (e.g. ~/.rlwrap),
and the filters in your $RLWRAP_FILTERDIR directory (e.g. ~/.rlwrap/filters).
* Usage
Use rlwrap's -z option to invoke a filter: =rlwrap -z "<FILTER>" <OTHER_OPTS> <CMD>=

If you want to use several filters, you can use the =pipeline= filter that comes with rlwrap,
like this:

=rlwrap -z 'pipeline <FILTER1>:<FILTER2>:<ETC>' <OTHER_OPTS> <CMD>=

Documentation for a particular filter can be viewed with: =rlwrap -z <FILTER>=
* Filters
 - *pipeto_macro* pipe output of REPL commands into shell commands, and back again, or save output into macros.
   Complete macros using [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]].
 - *handle_hotkeys_fzf* like the [[https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap/blob/master/filters/handle_hotkeys][handle_hotkeys]] filter that comes with rlwrap, but uses fzf, and has a few extra
   keybindings, such as *show_keys* (show keybindings) & *fzf_complete_history_word*
 - *uncolour* remove control chars from output text
